      <p>
        Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized
        applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer
        that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all
        states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum
        supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to
        program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) built on
        Ethereum include token, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps,
        lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.
