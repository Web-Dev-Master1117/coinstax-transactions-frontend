The key concept behind RAG is its ability to dynamically retrieve relevant information from a large corpus or knowledge base and seamlessly incorporate it into generative responses.
    In traditional generative models, outputs are generated based solely on the internal knowledge of the model. This can lead to issues with outdated information or hallucinations, where the model creates content that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. RAG mitigates these risks by integrating retrieval components that can access up-to-date and contextually appropriate information in real-time. This hybrid approach enhances accuracy and contextual relevance, making it ideal for applications like question answering, chatbots, and content creation tools.
    RAG's impact is transformative, enabling AI systems to provide more reliable and accurate responses while adapting to changing information landscapes. This flexibility opens the door to a range of new possibilities, from personalized virtual assistants to intelligent document summarization.
