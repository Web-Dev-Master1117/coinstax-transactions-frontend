## Why is this course different?

*By finishing the **"LLM Twin: Building Your Production-Ready AI Replica"** free course, you will learn how to design, train, and deploy a production-ready LLM twin of yourself powered by LLMs, vector DBs, and LLMOps good practices.*

> Why should you care? ü´µ
> 
> ‚Üí **No more isolated scripts or Notebooks!** Learn production ML by building and deploying an end-to-end production-grade LLM system.


## What will you learn to build by the end of this¬†course?

You will **learn** how to **architect** and **build a real-world LLM system** from **start** to **finish**‚Ää-‚Ääfrom **data collection** to **deployment**.

You will also **learn** to **leverage MLOps best practices**, such as experiment trackers, model registries, prompt monitoring, and versioning.

**The end goal?** Build and deploy your own LLM twin.

**What is an LLM Twin?** It is an AI character that learns to write like somebody by incorporating its style and personality into an LLM.

## The architecture of the LLM twin is split into 4 Python microservices:

### The data collection pipeline

- Crawl your digital data from various social media platforms.
- Clean, normalize and load the data to a [Mongo NoSQL DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) through a series of ETL pipelines.
- Send database changes to a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) queue using the CDC pattern.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### The feature pipeline

- Consume messages from a queue through a [Bytewax](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax?utm_source=github&utm_medium=decodingml&utm_campaign=2024_q1) streaming pipeline.
- Every message will be cleaned, chunked, embedded (using [Superlinked](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked-alpha?utm_source=community&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=oscourse), and loaded into a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) vector DB in real-time.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### The training pipeline
- Create a custom dataset based on your digital data.
- Fine-tune an LLM using QLoRA.
- Use [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) experiment tracker to monitor the experiments.
- Evaluate and save the best model to [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/lp/end-to-end-mlops/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=decodingml).

### The inference pipeline
- Load and quantize the fine-tuned LLM from [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry.
- Deploy it as a REST API.
- Enhance the prompts using RAG.
- Generate content using your LLM twin.
- Monitor the LLM using [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?framework=llm&utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) prompt monitoring dashboard.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/lp/end-to-end-mlops/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=decodingml).

Along the 4 microservices, you will learn to integrate 3 serverless tools:

* [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) as your ML Platform;
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) as your vector DB;
* [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/lp/end-to-end-mlops/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=decodingml) as your ML infrastructure;

## Who is this¬†for?

**Audience:** MLE, DE, DS, or SWE who want to learn to engineer production-ready LLM systems using LLMOps good principles.

**Level:** intermediate

**Prerequisites:** basic knowledge of Python, ML, and the cloud

## How will you¬†learn?

The course contains **11 hands-on written lessons** and the **open-source code** you can access on GitHub.

You can read everything and try out the code at your own pace.¬†

## Costs?
The **articles** and **code** are **completely free**. They will always remain free.

But if you plan to run the code while reading it, you have to know that we use several cloud tools that might generate additional costs.

The cloud computing platforms ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Qwak](https://www.qwak.com/lp/end-to-end-mlops/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=decodingml)) have a pay-as-you-go pricing plan. Qwak offers a few hours of free computing. Thus, we did our best to keep costs to a minimum.

For the other serverless tools ([Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course), [Comet](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github)), we will stick to their freemium version, which is free of charge.

## Lessons
