# Module 2: Change Data Capture: Enabling Event-Driven Architectures


## Introduction
Change Data Capture, commonly known as CDC, is an efficient way to track changes in a database.

The purpose of CDC is to capture insertions, updates, and deletions applied to a database and to make this change data available in a format easily consumable by downstream applications.
Why do we need CDC pattern?

    Real-time Data Syncing: CDC facilitates near-real-time data integration and syncing.
    Efficient Data Pipelines: It allows incremental data loading, which is more efficient than bulk load operations.
    Minimized System Impact: CDC minimizes the impact on the source system by reducing the need for performance-intensive queries.
    Event-Driven Architectures: It enables event-driven architectures by streaming database events.
